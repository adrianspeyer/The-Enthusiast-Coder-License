# The Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL)

## Why This License Exists

The Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL) was born from a simple reality: not everyone who writes and shares code is a professional developer. Many of us are business professionals, enthusiasts, or hobbyists who code because we love it, want to solve problems, or simply enjoy creating things.

## Core Principles

1. **Honesty About Who We Are**
   - We're not professional developers
   - We code for fun, learning, and problem-solving
   - Our primary jobs or responsibilities lie elsewhere

2. **Transparency About Support**
   - No guaranteed response times
   - No formal support structure
   - Updates and improvements happen organically
   - Our involvement is based on available time and interest

3. **Encouraging Sharing and Learning**
   - Share your code freely
   - Learn from others
   - Contribute back when possible
   - Build on each other's work

4. **Fair Recognition**
   - Credit original authors
   - Acknowledge sources
   - Share improvements back with the community
   - Consider fair compensation for commercial success

## Who Should Use This License

- Business professionals who code on the side
- Hobby programmers sharing their projects
- Weekend coders with useful tools to share
- Anyone who codes for fun but wants to be clear about support limitations

## What Makes EnCL Different

Unlike traditional software licenses that assume professional development practices, EnCL embraces the reality of hobby coding:

- Clear expectations about support and maintenance
- Honest about the developer's status and availability
- Encourages commercial users to give back
- Maintains the spirit of open source while being realistic about limitations

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're a marketing professional who created a useful data analysis tool for your work. It's good enough that others might find it valuable, but:
- You can't promise to fix bugs immediately
- You might improve it when you have time
- You're happy to share it but can't offer professional support
- You want credit if someone uses it successfully

EnCL is designed exactly for situations like this.

## Using EnCL

1. If you're a creator:
   - Add the EnCL license to your project
   - Be clear about your status as an enthusiast coder
   - Share updates and improvements when you can
   - Maintain ownership of your contribution pace

2. If you're a user:
   - Understand the nature of enthusiast-created code
   - Test thoroughly before production use
   - Consider contributing improvements
   - Provide attribution as specified
   - Consider fair compensation for commercial success

## The Spirit of EnCL

EnCL embodies the joy of coding while being realistic about limitations. It's about creating a space where enthusiast coders can share their work proudly, without the pressure of professional software development expectations.

## Origins

Created in 2025 by Adrian Speyer, EnCL addresses the gap between traditional software licenses and the reality of hobby coding. It provides a framework for sharing code that respects both the creator's limitations and the user's needs.

## Get Involved

- Use EnCL for your projects
- Share your experiences
- Suggest improvements
- Help build a community of enthusiast coders

Remember: EnCL is about making code sharing more accessible and honest for everyone who codes for the love of it.
