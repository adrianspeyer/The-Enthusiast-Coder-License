# The Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL)

## Why This License Exists

The Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL) was born from a simple reality: not everyone who writes and shares code is a professional developer. Many of us are business professionals, enthusiasts, or hobbyists who code because we love it, want to solve problems, or simply enjoy creating things.

## Core Principles

1. **Honesty About Who We Are**
   - We're not professional developers
   - We code for fun, learning, and problem-solving
   - Our primary jobs or responsibilities lie elsewhere

2. **Transparency About Support**
   - No guaranteed response times
   - No formal support structure
   - Updates and improvements happen organically
   - Our involvement is based on available time and interest

3. **Encouraging Sharing and Learning**
   - Share your code freely
   - Learn from others
   - Contribute back when possible
   - Build on each other's work

4. **Fair Recognition**
   - Credit original authors
   - Acknowledge sources
   - Share improvements back with the community
   - Consider fair compensation for commercial success

## Who Should Use This License

- Business professionals who code on the side
- Hobby programmers sharing their projects
- Weekend coders with useful tools to share
- Anyone who codes for fun but wants to be clear about support limitations

## What Makes EnCL Different

Unlike traditional software licenses that assume professional development practices, EnCL embraces the reality of hobby coding:

- Clear expectations about support and maintenance
- Honest about the developer's status and availability
- Encourages commercial users to give back
- Maintains the spirit of open source while being realistic about limitations

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're a marketing professional who created a useful data analysis tool for your work. It's good enough that others might find it valuable, but:
- You can't promise to fix bugs immediately
- You might improve it when you have time
- You're happy to share it but can't offer professional support
- You want credit if someone uses it successfully

EnCL is designed exactly for situations like this.

## Using EnCL

1. If you're a creator:
   - Add the EnCL license to your project
   - Be clear about your status as an enthusiast coder
   - Share updates and improvements when you can
   - Maintain ownership of your contribution pace

2. If you're a user:
   - Understand the nature of enthusiast-created code
   - Test thoroughly before production use
   - Consider contributing improvements
   - Provide attribution as specified
   - Consider fair compensation for commercial success

## The Spirit of EnCL

EnCL embodies the joy of coding while being realistic about limitations. It's about creating a space where enthusiast coders can share their work proudly, without the pressure of professional software development expectations.

## Origins

Created in 2025 by Adrian Speyer, EnCL addresses the gap between traditional software licenses and the reality of hobby coding. It provides a framework for sharing code that respects both the creator's limitations and the user's needs.

## Get Involved

- Use EnCL for your projects
- Share your experiences
- Suggest improvements
- Help build a community of enthusiast coders

Remember: EnCL is about making code sharing more accessible and honest for everyone who codes for the love of it.

## License Flexibility and Derivative Works

EnCL is intentionally flexible when it comes to derivative works. Here's what this means:

- **Derivative Works**: Others can take EnCL-licensed code and release their modified versions under different licenses
- **Original Code**: The original portions remain under EnCL, requiring proper attribution
- **Mixed Licensing**: Projects can contain both EnCL and non-EnCL code
- **No Share-Alike Requirement**: We don't force others to use EnCL for their modifications

### Real-World Examples

1. **The Analytics Dashboard Scenario**
   - Original: A marketing professional creates a data visualization dashboard under EnCL
   - Derivative: A software company incorporates it into their product under MIT license
   - Result: They must credit the original author, but can provide full support for their version
   
2. **The Utility Script Evolution**
   - Original: A business analyst shares a PDF processing script under EnCL
   - Derivative: A developer expands it into a full-featured library under Apache 2.0
   - Result: Original code attribution remains, but the library can have professional support

3. **The API Wrapper Growth**
   - Original: A hobbyist creates a basic API wrapper under EnCL
   - Derivative: A startup builds a commercial product around it
   - Result: They can offer enterprise support while maintaining original attribution

The key point is that while the original author provides no support under EnCL, derivative work creators can choose to provide any level of support they wish. The EnCL restrictions and disclaimers only apply to the original code in its original form.

This flexibility is intentional because:
- It encourages innovation and reuse
- It allows integration with other open source projects
- It reduces barriers to adoption
- It focuses on attribution rather than restriction

## Why EnCL Was Created

EnCL emerged from several key observations:

1. **The Reality Gap**
   - Traditional licenses assume professional development practices
   - Many coders today are professionals in other fields
   - Support expectations needed to be more realistic

2. **The Honesty Principle**
   - Being upfront about hobby code nature
   - Setting clear expectations about support
   - Protecting both creators and users through clarity

3. **The Support Dilemma**
   - Hobby coders want to share but can't provide professional support
   - Users need to understand what they're getting into
   - Traditional licenses don't address this clearly enough

4. **Common Scenarios**
   - Marketing professionals sharing automation scripts
   - Business analysts sharing data tools
   - Product managers sharing prototypes
   - Anyone who codes for fun sharing useful tools

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why create a new license instead of using existing ones?**
A: While many great licenses exist, none clearly communicate the nature of hobby coding and set appropriate expectations about support and maintenance.

**Q: Is this an anti-professional license?**
A: Not at all! It's about honesty and setting correct expectations. Professional developers can use EnCL too when sharing personal projects.

**Q: Does this discourage people from using the code?**
A: It discourages casual dependency without proper consideration, which is actually a feature, not a bug.

**Q: What if I want to provide support later?**
A: You can always choose to provide more support than the license requires, or you can release a new version under a different license.

## The Spirit of Reciprocity

While EnCL is a permissive license with no strict requirements beyond attribution, it embodies a hope for mutual benefit and community goodwill. Here's what we encourage (but don't require):

1. **Sharing Success**
   - If your product becomes commercially successful using EnCL code, consider reaching out to the original author
   - While attribution is required by the license, there are many ways to show appreciation for code that brings value to your project
   - The open source community thrives on mutual respect and recognition of value created
   - Success takes many forms, and sharing that success (in whatever way feels appropriate) strengthens the community
   - Every contribution to open source has value - how you recognize that value is up to you

2. **Code Improvements**
   - When you enhance EnCL code, consider sharing those improvements back if feasible
   - While not all modifications can be shared (due to business restrictions, complexity, or other reasons), sharing what you can helps everyone
   - Even sharing knowledge about how the code was enhanced can be valuable

3. **Community Growth**
   - Success stories encourage other enthusiast coders to share their work
   - Reciprocity builds a stronger community
   - Your success might inspire others to share their code

Remember: These are hopes and aspirations, not requirements. EnCL is designed to give you complete freedom in how you use the code, while gently encouraging a spirit of sharing and mutual benefit when possible.

Think of EnCL as sending your code into the universe with a clear message about its origins and nature, but without controlling its entire future journey. While proper attribution must be maintained, projects incorporating EnCL code can offer their own support, maintenance, and guarantees. The original EnCL disclaimers only apply to the code in its original form from the original author.

For example:
- If a company incorporates your EnCL-licensed utility function into their enterprise software, they can provide full support and warranties for their product
- If a developer builds a larger library around your EnCL code, they can offer professional maintenance for their enhanced version
- If a startup uses your EnCL code as a foundation, they can provide SLAs and guarantees for their commercial offering

The key is that EnCL's "no support" provisions are about the original author's obligations, not restrictions on what others can offer when they build upon or incorporate the code.
