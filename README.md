# The Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL)

[![EnCL Licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-EnCL-0291db.svg)](LICENSE.md)

## Introduction

The Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL) was born from a simple reality: not everyone who writes and shares code is a professional developer. Many of us are business professionals, enthusiasts, and hobbyists who code because we love it, want to solve problems, or simply enjoy creating things. EnCL provides a framework for sharing this code honestly and openly.
