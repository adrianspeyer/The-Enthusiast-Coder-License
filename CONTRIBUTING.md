# Contributing to EnCL

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Enthusiast Coder License (EnCL)! 

## A Personal Note

EnCL isn't just a license - it's a hobby project that reflects the reality of enthusiast coding. As its creator, I'm a parent with a toddler, a busy professional, and someone who codes to relieve stress, not create it. This means:

- Response times will vary significantly
- I may have limited "me time" to review suggestions
- Updates happen when life and energy permit
- This project should remain fun and stress-free

## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Improvements

Feel free to open an issue if you have suggestions, but please:
- Be respectful and constructive
- Understand that implementation isn't guaranteed
- Accept that timing will be variable
- Provide clear reasoning for changes

### The Review Process

As this is a hobby project:
- Reviews happen when time and energy allow
- Not all suggestions will be implemented
- Changes need careful consideration
- The process should remain stress-free

### License Text Changes

The license text itself is particularly sensitive:
- Changes need thorough discussion
- Legal implications must be considered
- The spirit of EnCL must be maintained
- Modifications should improve clarity or address genuine gaps

## Communication Guidelines

- Be patient and understanding
- Keep discussions respectful
- Remember this is a hobby project
- Accept that responses may take time

## Questions About Contributing?

Feel free to open an issue for discussion. Just remember that EnCL is about honest sharing and clear expectations - including how contributions are handled.

## Version Updates

The EnCL version number (currently 1.02) will only change when meaningful updates are made to the license text. This helps users track which version they're using while maintaining simplicity.

* 1.0 - Initial release
* 1.01 - Minor text clarifications
* 1.02 - Added derivative works section (current)
* 2.0 - Would be for major changes (in the future...)

Remember: EnCL exists to make hobby coding more honest and accessible. Let's maintain that spirit in how we collaborate on improving it.
